    今天來學習怎麼繪製 3D 列印的模型繪製，使用的是 TinkerCad。我用起來覺得很好用，比起其他的 3D 建模軟體來說更直觀，不會打退一些初學者的心態，而且又能達到一樣的效果，所以我覺得這個軟體學會了對於創客類型的實作都能吃到。

    像是他裡面貫穿的方式很直觀，就一種方式，像是 Solidworks 就一大堆，其實我們也用不到這麼多，簡簡單單的不就好了。

    另外他還有一個功能我覺得還不錯，就是文字輸入的功能，他的功能做得很簡潔，即輸入即用，也很好調整他的尺寸，就是直接拉取就可以他的邊框就好。

    而我畫的是一個 Apple watch 的 Case，希望說可以成功套在我的手錶上面。最後也和助教一起聊到一些未來規劃的事情，就覺得說在最近這麼忙的情況下，還有一個人可以陪我聊天感覺很好。

    Today, I learned how to design a 3D printing model using TinkerCad. I found it very user-friendly and more intuitive compared to other 3D modeling software, which often discourages beginners. Despite its simplicity, TinkerCad can achieve the same results, making it a great tool for maker-type projects.

    For example, the way it handles cutouts is straightforward—there’s just one method. In contrast, software like Solidworks offers many options, most of which we don’t really need. Sometimes simplicity works better.

    Another feature I liked was the text input function. It’s very clean and easy to use—just type and go. Adjusting the size is also simple, as you can resize the text box directly by dragging its edges.

    I designed an Apple Watch case and hope it will fit my watch perfectly. Lastly, I had a conversation with the teaching assistant about some future plans. It felt really nice to have someone to talk to, especially when things are so busy lately.
