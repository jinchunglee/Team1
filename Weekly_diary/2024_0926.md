# Weekly progression (Week 2)
- James Lee 李晉丞：
  
    身為這組的組長，我這週把Readme的文章結構規劃出來給組員們撰寫，由於我之前有架過網站的經驗，所以我也有規劃將這個project利用github pages的方式，用網站呈現，所以一開始在規劃上就以未來架設網站方便為主。另外我也在Line上面建立了一個群組，讓我們組可以在上面交流。

    這週還有看到3D列印的成果，感覺很新奇，因為之前都沒有真正做出來，都是在軟體上設計。這堂課真的物超所值，學到很多東西。

    下禮拜就要跟那邊的負責人對談了，我們組的策略是「以所需，做所求」，因為假如我們一直照著我們的想法，卻沒有對實際情況調查和評估，會努力錯地方。
    
    這就像是我們硬去製造了一個需求出來，但是他有可能不切實際，以至於不被市場或者是使用者所接受。所以這就是我們想等跟負責人們對談甚至是到實際現場後，再做討論，這也比較像是一個產品開發的流程。大家都有很多想法，但是能不能正中紅心，那是另一門學問了。

    As the team leader, I structured the content of the README this week and assigned the writing tasks to the team members. Since I have previous experience building websites, I also planned to use GitHub Pages to present this project as a website. Therefore, from the start, the planning was focused on making it convenient for future website setup. Additionally, I created a group chat on Line for our team to communicate and exchange ideas.

    This week, I also saw the results of 3D printing, which felt quite novel because, in the past, we had only designed in software without actually producing anything. This class is truly worth the value; I’ve learned a lot.

    Next week, we will meet with the person in charge. Our team’s strategy is to "do what is needed based on the requirements." If we keep following only our own ideas without investigating and assessing the real situation, we might be putting effort in the wrong direction.

    It's like we're creating a demand out of thin air, which might not be practical and could be rejected by the market or users. So, we plan to wait until after the discussion with the person in charge and possibly visit the actual site before we finalize the direction. This resembles a real product development process. Everyone has many ideas, but whether they hit the mark is a whole different matter.
